			<h3>Hi Brian :)</h3>
			<div class="broedtekst">
				You're the only person who has the address of this page!<br />
				<br />
				I'm in the proces of recording and mixing this song "Loke" that I've written.
				There are still a lot of things I'm not totally satisfied with -
				the quality of recording of the vocals for instance...
				and I think I overdid the effects...
				list of some of the things that I think is wrong at the bottom of the page.<br />
				<br />
				Now; you've done a lot of mixing, so if you have the time, could you give it
				a listen? I would much appreciate any criticism and advice :-D<br />

			<h3>Translated lyrics</h3>
			<div class="broedtekst">
				<i>No rhyme or rhytm preserved.<br />
				Some words and phrases may not be 100% correct English...</i><br />
				<br />
				Am I alive or am I dead?<br />
				Is this the blood of my own flesh? <span class="nb">1)</span><br />
				What am I doing in this hole/dump?<br />
				Is that the glare of my victory bonfire?<br />
				<br />
				Well, look who's coming there!<br />
				The Savior himself and his salvation army!<br />
				You won't sell anything here<br />
				You're a sheep in sheep's clothing!<br />
				<br />
				For I've led your children into the safe embrace of sin<br />
				And I taught them to substitute love with loss<br />
				And I gave/granted them fire, and I collected my payment<br />
				And they trusted me alone, when it really mattered!<br />
				<br />
				So set me loose, sissy girl!<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;for the wolf must have his yummy!<br />
				I could only win the war,<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;for I'm completely shameless!<br />
				In my heroes shape <span class="nb">2)</span><br />
				I set the World on fire!<br />
				<br />
				You've lost, you see it now<br />
				There's no reason, there's no God<br />
				There's just the shit we shit ourselves<br />
				So dry your eyes, sissy girl, don't weep!<br />
				<br />
				For I took you children, it was almost too easy<br />
				And I used them thoroughly before you got them back<br />
				And I gave/granted them the Moon, and I collected my payment<br />
				And they trusted me alone, when it really mattered!<br />
				<br />
				And I sat on my throne<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;and saw that all was evil!<br />
				All the devils were howling<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;while the rabble was being kicked around!<br />
				In the wickedest bad ass style<br />
				I run the party all too wild!<br />
				<br />
				For I've killed your children!<br />
				<br />
				I've killed your children, they stood still like lambs!<br />
				And they wrote thick books saying that you and I are the same!<br />
				And I promised them Heaven, and I collected my payment<br />
				And they trusted me alone, when it really mattered!<br />
				<br />
				So now you must give me your position/place<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fortress of heaven!<br />
				No, I don't want your forgiveness!<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;You can shove it up!<br />
				The good cry snot<br />
				And the rest think they're doing so well!<br />
				<br />
				<i>Set me free, set me free!</i><br />
				I drank their blood like wine<br />
				while the gnomes were howling with laughter!<br />
				<br />
				<i>(crash)</i><br />
				Where did you go?...<br />
				<br />
				<span class="nb">1)</span> A word play on "my own flesh and blood"
				(Loke's son(s) were brutally murdered by the other Norse gods).<br />
				<span class="nb">2)</span> Loke was a shape shifter.

			<h3>What is wrong</h3>
			<div class="broedtekst">
				Some of the things that are wrong:
				<ul>
					<li>
						By mistake more than half of the vocals are recorded with
						the internal microphone of my laptop...
						Picture me <i>screaming</i> into my Logitech mike - not
						realising I forgot to select it as input....
					</li>
					<li>
						Too much reverb on the drums.
					</li>
					<li>
						The bass shouldn't have been so loud in the mix -
						and shouldn't have been distorted.
					</li>
					<li>
						Too much distortion on the final mix.
					</li>
				</ul>
