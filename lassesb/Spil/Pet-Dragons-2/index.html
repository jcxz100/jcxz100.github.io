            <h3>PD2: A Difficult Game</h3>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/petdragonstwo/" target="_blank">Pet Dragons 2</a>
                is a game developed by
                <a href="http://forums.liquidfyre.com/" target="_blank">LiquidFyre</a>.
                You need a facebook account to play.<br />
                PD2 is a little difficult to play at first, 
                but when you've played for some time,
                you realize it is also extremely hard to master... 
                so there's a balance there... sort of ;-)<br />
            </div>

            <h4>Math</h4>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                Lots of people have made educated (and wild) guesses as to the math behind the game.
                <a href="http://forums.liquidfyre.com/index.php?topic=4419.0" target="_blank">
                    One of these threads of guesses</a
                >
                have made me create
                <a href="Balanced-Build.html">
                    this page for calculating an approximate "balanced build"</a
                >.<br />
                The calculator hasn't been modified since early 2011 - I've been notified that my
                experimental speed calculations don't fit for larger dragons, so you
                should probably stay with the original formula there.<br />

                ><br />
                <!--(Note: Old WDoV tagged picture <a href="drarwe_onethird_onbluesky_illum_2_WDoV.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.)
                <br /-->
                (Note: As per Seventh Day policy the picture, where DarWe
                wears the their tag, is no longer available.)
            </div>
            <h4>Motto</h4>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                DarWe's motto is: <i>"I eat Ching, once eat Confucius too"</i>.<br />
                This rather pidgeon English sounding motto has some hidden meanings!<br />
                <ol>
                <li>
                    "I eat Ching" pronounces almost like "<h5 class="inline">I Ching</h5>",
                    which is an ancient Chinese method of fortunetelling,
                    which hints at the fact, that DarWe's favorite element is:<br />
                    - <i>Psychic</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, Master Confucius was mixed up in the creation
                    of I Ching - but "<h5 class="inline">Konfu</h5>"
                    also happens to be the Danish word for an Asian martial art,
                    which in turn has given name to a Danish ice lolly
                    (white with a brown belt of cola flavor,
                    overlaid with white liquorice tip),
                    so actually this hints at two other elements DarWe has used:<br />
                    - <i>Ice</i> which he used a lot for half a year, and<br />
                    - <i>Air</i> which he used in the early days (up until around age 180).<br />
                    (He has also been <i>Metal</i> for a while, but that's a whole different story
                    - and not a very successful one.)
                </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Clans</h3>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                Clans were never fully incorporated into pd2,
                but even so they're the main reason the game still exists.<br />
                It is so much more fun to have people to discuss politics and
                assists with.
            </div>

            <h4>First Clan: WDoV</h4>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                DarWe used to be a member of the proto-clan
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/83072970043/?ref=ts"
                    target="_blank"
                >
                    "Winged Dragons of Vatchestan"</a
                >
                (even though he has no wings and flies by use of telekinesis!).<br />
                Much fun was had;
                but as of August 2012 WDoV was practically defunct.<br/>

            <h4>Previous Clan: TSD</h4>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                I joined up with The Seventh Day for a while.
            </div>

            <h4>Current Clan: WDoV - again</h4>
            <div class="broedtekst">
                After a two year pause in playing
                I donned the WDoV banner again.
                It has no obligations and better fits my very casual
                playing style.<br/>
                I am only online for a few days
                before pausing again,
                and I don't much care for
                the extra, imho unnecessary rules,
                that all clans (except WDoV)
                want their members to follow.
